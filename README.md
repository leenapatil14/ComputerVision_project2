#### RANSAC Algorithm Problem and Image Stitching Problem.
#### Objective Given:
1. The goal of this task is to fit a line to the given points using RANSAC algorithm, and output
the names of inlier points and outlier points for the line.
2. The goal of this task is to stitch two images of overlap into one image.
To this end, you need to find feature points of interest in one image, and then find
the corresponding ones in another image. After this, you can simply stitch the two images
by aligning the matched feature points.

#### Tasks performed:
1. Implemented the RANSAC Algorithm in python. 
2. Used ORB with Brute-force Matcher for feature detection and matching.
3. Found the Homography and stitched two images.


##### Issues:
None.
